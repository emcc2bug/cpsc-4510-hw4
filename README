 README file for Project 3 - Simple TCP

================================================

We make heavy use of switch cases & function maps to handle functioning
    essentially, operating like a FSM would, and just implementing STCP based off the TCP FSM (obviously without certain components that a TCP FSM would need to be fully implemented).

We rely heavily on our states for aforementioned reasons - we wanted to just implement the FSM, and making sure we knew what context state we were in was deemed very important.

We use a very basic sliding window buffer because we didn't think something beyond that was necessary. if we still have data in the buffer *after* we fill our window up, we can just call wait_for_event (and therefore stcp_app_recv) again, and load up more data into our buffer. if our window's full, obviously there are bigger problems than our window code being the way it is.

Additionally, you have to modify the makefile to set it to C++ 11 or it won't compile.
